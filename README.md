### Overview
- Basic application showing mutations and queries in [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) using the [React Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/essentials/get-started.html)
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). We then added the required Apollo & GraphQL libraries
  ```console
  npm install apollo-boost react-apollo graphql --save
  ```

- This is the server the application connects to https://launchpad.graphql.com/r9x8jkr0qn
