### Overview
- Basic application showing mutations and queries in [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) using the [React Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/essentials/get-started.html)
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). We then added the required Apollo & GraphQL libraries
  ```console
  npm install apollo-boost react-apollo graphql --save
  ```
- We utilize stateless functional components in this example to minimize code written and hopefully for more clarity when reading the code. More information is available here: [React Stateless Functional Components: Nine Wins You Might Have Overlooked](https://hackernoon.com/react-stateless-functional-components-nine-wins-you-might-have-overlooked-997b0d933dbc)
- This is the server the application connects to https://launchpad.graphql.com/r9x8jkr0qn
